form handling and working with forms
handle backend process of forms and making sure the data coming form any frontend lib,fw, templating engines, we still handle it at the backend


we can put any data on frontend on browser and whenever you request anything on backend that frontend saved data will automatically go to backend
 
session cookie

ek person and a facebook server
-----
so person asks facebook server for a photo
server asks person who are you
person logins
server gives photo ok you are peter
peter likes a photoserver fter giving photo forgot who is peter and asks again who are you
peter again logins


to solve this
---
server sends photo with a string eg abcd which is stored in web browser
next whenever you do or ask something you send it with this string so server knows you are peter
without that server asks who are you
this string stored on frontend is called cookie
this connection b/w person and server through cookie is called session
if we remove this string from frontend then you logout session terminated.
this cookie is mainly used for authentication



so if you write your name eg: aahaan on a google form 
that name is converted to blob - unreadable on screen , in hexadecimmal  and sent to server
this blob is a mixture of every data very mixed up - raita bangya h to be sent to server
not readable directly
to handle this ki blob ko readable krna hoga so server reads it
to do that we use
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}))
this blob is not correct way to address it
