node js core me whatever is installed is module and what we install using npm is package

uninstall -> npm uninstall packageName

installing particular version -> npm i packageName@version


dependencies -> packages and packages ki dependencies
devdependecies -> aise packages jo sirf development me kaam ayenge but when app deployed then those packages will not be used


scripts -> when you run a script
npm start
npm run dev
npm run concurrent

npm start and npm test are known by the os already when node is installed start & test words are stored there
anything apart from start & test we use run before it . 
eg: npm run dev -> WORK
npm dev -> NOT WORK
