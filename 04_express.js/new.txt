express.js is a npm package
framework -> is a flow which says we have to do this thing like this only
express js manages everything from reciving the request and giving the response
from accepting a req at a server to everything is express.js

nodemon  filename  - running like this can make the site run live with live changes
node filename - you have to end then restart for changes


middleware -> 


you send a req from laptop to facebook it goes to facebook server handles routes and then responds .... this is how it goes but it will not 
there will be a middleware before routes 
in middleware we can do any work
for eg: if we want first req come then print hello then go to routes.
